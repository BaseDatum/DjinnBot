# DjinnBot

> Deploy a team of autonomous AI agents that collaborate on any workflow — engineering, research, content, operations, finance. Each agent has a distinct persona, persistent memory, a full toolbox inside an isolated Docker container, and can be reached from Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, or the built-in chat. Self-hosted and free.

## Getting Started

- [Installation](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/getting-started/installation/): One-line installer, Docker Compose setup, prerequisites, and environment configuration.
- [First Run](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/getting-started/first-run/): Creating your admin account, running your first pipeline, and basic usage.
- [Dashboard Tour](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/getting-started/dashboard-tour/): Overview of the real-time dashboard — activity feed, kanban boards, pipeline views, and admin panel.

## Core Concepts

- [Agents](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/agents/): Agent anatomy (IDENTITY, SOUL, AGENTS, DECISION, PULSE, config.yml), the default team of 11 agents, and how to create custom agents.
- [Architecture](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/architecture/): System architecture — FastAPI server, Pipeline Engine, Redis Streams, PostgreSQL, agent containers, JuiceFS, and messaging bridges.
- [Pipelines](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/pipelines/): YAML-defined multi-agent workflows with steps, branching, loops, retries, structured output, and per-step model overrides.
- [Memory](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/memory/): ClawVault persistent memory with semantic search (QMDR), wiki-linked knowledge graph, memory scoring, and 3D visualization.
- [Pulse](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/pulse/): Named pulse routines — autonomous wake-up schedules, blackout windows, stagger offsets, and wake guardrails.
- [Storage](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/storage/): JuiceFS FUSE mount with RustFS (S3-compatible object store) for shared POSIX filesystem across containers.
- [Containers](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/containers/): Ephemeral Docker agent containers with Node 22, Python 3, Go, Rust, Camoufox browser, and 30+ tools.
- [Workspaces](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/workspaces/): Multi-workspace support for organizing projects and agents.
- [Code Knowledge Graph](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/code-knowledge-graph/): Tree-sitter-based structural codebase understanding stored in KuzuDB — functions, classes, call chains, and clusters queryable by agents.
- [Programmatic Tool Calling](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/programmatic-tool-calling/): Compact Python function signatures replace verbose JSON schemas, reducing prompt overhead by 12x.
- [Event-Driven Wakes](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/event-driven-wakes/): Agents waking each other based on events and coordination triggers.
- [MCP Tools](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/mcp-tools/): Model Context Protocol tool server integration via mcpo proxy with hot-reload.
- [Skills](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/skills/): Reusable skill packages with references and templates that agents can use.
- [Secrets](https://docs.djinn.bot/docs/concepts/secrets/): Encrypted secret management for agents and pipelines.
