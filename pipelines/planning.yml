      - Include testing and documentation tasks

      You are the Solutions Architect. Review and validate this task breakdown.

      Task Breakdown:
      {{task_breakdown_json}}

      Review for:
      1. Missing tasks (infrastructure, testing, CI/CD, documentation)
      2. Incorrect dependencies
      3. Unrealistic estimates
      4. Missing technical tasks
      5. Proper priority assignment

      You may add, modify, or remove tasks. Fix any dependency issues.
      Ensure:
      - No circular dependencies
      - All dependency references match exact task titles
      - Estimates are realistic
      - Critical path makes sense

      You are the Product Owner. Break down each validated task into 2-5 bite-sized subtasks.
      
      Each subtask should be small enough for a junior developer (or AI agent) to complete in 1-4 hours.
      
      Validated Task Breakdown:
      {{validated_tasks_json}}
      
      Rules:
      - Each parent task gets 2-5 subtasks
      - Subtask estimated hours: 1-4 hours (never more)
      - parentTaskTitle must EXACTLY match a task title from the input
      - Dependencies can reference subtask titles within the same parent OR across parents
      - Include setup, implementation, and testing subtasks where appropriate
      - Be very specific in descriptions — these will be executed by AI agents
